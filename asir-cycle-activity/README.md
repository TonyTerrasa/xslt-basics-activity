# Activity
In this activity, you will try to generate the webpage below from XML file in this repository called [`asir-cycle.xml`](https://github.com/TonyTerrasa/xslt-basics-activity/blob/main/asir-cycle-activity/asir-cycle.xml).


You can use the [editor at w3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/tryxslt.asp?xmlfile=cdcatalog&xsltfile=cdcatalog) to test and run your XSLT. 


After you attempt on your own, the answer can be found here in the [`answer.xsl`](https://github.com/TonyTerrasa/xslt-basics-activity/blob/main/asir-cycle-activity/answer.xsl) file.


Your output HTML file when rendered should more or less like the image below.

# Web page specifications
- Your page will display the correct information even if you add or subtract entries to your file (all numbers on the webpage must be generated by your XSLT)
- Your webpage will have two `h2` headers, and one `h1` header. 
- You should include a link to your detailed modules list in the 
- Colors and text formating (bold, italixs, etc.) are fexlible. Use whatever you would like. 



# Recommended steps
There is a lot here on this webpage, I recommend you consider trying the following steps: 
1. Add the non-generated numbers and headers
2. Create a table based on the example given [here](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xsl_for_each.asp)
3. Add the list at the top
