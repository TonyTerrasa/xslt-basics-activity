# Activity
In this activity, you will try to generate the webpage below from XML file in this repository called [`asir-cycle.xml`](https://github.com/TonyTerrasa/xslt-basics-activity/blob/main/asir-cycle-activity/asir-cycle.xml).


You can use the [editor at w3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/tryxslt.asp?xmlfile=cdcatalog&xsltfile=cdcatalog) to test and run your XSLT. 


After you attempt on your own, the answer can be found here in the [`answer.xsl`](https://github.com/TonyTerrasa/xslt-basics-activity/blob/main/asir-cycle-activity/answer.xsl) file.


Your output HTML file when rendered should more or less like the image below.

# Web page specifications
- Your page will display the correct information even if you add or subtract entries to your file (all numbers on the webpage must be generated by your XSLT)
- Your webpage will have two `h2` headers, and one `h1` header as well as a table
- In one section, you should give an overview of the cycle and list the modules. The list of modules should also have the number of hours in parenthesis
- In the second section, your should have a table giving all the information available about each module
- Your table should show the total number of hours and the total number of sessions in the last row
- You should include a link to your detailed modules list somewhere in your first section
- **Colors and text formating (bold, italixs, etc.) are fexlible. Use whatever you would like**



# Recommended steps
There is a lot here on this webpage, I recommend you consider trying the following steps: 
1. Add the non-generated numbers and headers
2. Create a table based on the example given [here](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xsl_for_each.asp)
3. Add the row with the total hours and total session to your table
4. Add the list at the top
