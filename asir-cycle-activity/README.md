# Activity
In this activity, you will try to generate the webpage below from XML file in this repository called ´[asir-cycle.xml](https://github.com/TonyTerrasa/xslt-basics-activity/blob/main/asir-cycle-activity/asir-cycle.xml)´.


You can use the [editor at w3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/tryxslt.asp?xmlfile=cdcatalog&xsltfile=cdcatalog) to test and run your XSLT. 


After you attempt on your own, the answer can be found here in the ´[answer.xsl](https://github.com/TonyTerrasa/xslt-basics-activity/blob/main/asir-cycle-activity/answer.xsl)´ file.


Your output HTML file when rendered should more or less like the image below.
